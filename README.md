> NB: It's recommended to do all of the exercises from this part into a new dedicated git repository, and place your source code right at the root of the repository. Otherwise , you will run into problems in exercise 3.10.

> NB: Because this is not a frontend project and we are not working with React, the application is not created with create-react-app. You initialize this project with the npm init command that was demonstrated earlier in this part of the material .

> Strong recommendation : When you are working on backend code, always keep an eye on what's going on in the terminal that is running your application.
